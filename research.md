### Development of a detailed reaction mechanism for thermal decomposition of nitramines in liquid phase
Thermal decomposition of nitramine based energetic materials, i.e., RDX and HMX, is investigated using quantum mechanics calculations. A detailed chemical kinetic mechanism consisting of 403 species and 583 elementary reactions has been developed.   

### Thermophysical properties of energetic materials using molecular dynamics simulations
Classical non-reactive molecular dynamics simulations are performed to calculate temperature dependent thermophysical properties such as density, enthalpy of vaporization, heat capacity, viscosity, and thermal conductivity. Force field parameters are developed from quantum mechanics calculations.

### Chemical kinetic modeling of Confined Rapid Thermolysis of HMX
Thermal decomposition of HMX in condensed phase is simulated by solving species conservation equations in the condensed phase and gas phase using the detailed reaction mechanism previously developed.

### Transport parameters for gas-phase combustion modeling of energetic materials
Intermolecular potential parameters for collision of various organic energetic materials with four different bath gases are developed using quantum mechanics calculations. Lennard-Jones parameters are then calculated and a transport parameters database is developed which is used in gas-phase combustion modeling of RDX in open source chemical kinetics software Cantera.
